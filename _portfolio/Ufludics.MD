# Function

This 3D-printed microfluidic device demonstrates a cost-effective alternative to using silicon wafers to design and create microfluidic devices. This device was concept tested using plastic particles of different sizes and sorting them into respective channels. However the broader aplications include sorting cells of different types soley on size.

# Operation 
Water is pumped through one of the inlet channels, and the medium with particles is pumped through another at constant flow rates. Sorting will occur and particles will flow out sorted by size.
